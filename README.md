# Data analyst project
Complex data analyst project - payrolls and prices in Czech republic.

Downloading data via SQL (2 tables were done - first for Czech republic, second for other countries) and SQL scripts with queries as answers on data analyst questions.

Data in csv files (Data_HDP_pandas, SQL project).

Questions and answers in attached accompanying_document. 

Visualisation of data was done in Power BI and Python (Pandas).

All in Czech language! 

Part of this project (SQL, Power BI) was done for data analyst course. I "updated" this project by Python analyses.
